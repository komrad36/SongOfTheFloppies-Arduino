# SongOfTheFloppies-Arduino
Arduino component of SongOfTheFloppies. Receives serial commands and plays MIDI files on floppy drives.
Designed for MEGA 2560.

May need to reduce serial baud rate in both computer and floppy programs if long cable or on Linux.

A couple video examples I made are available here (work in progress!!):
